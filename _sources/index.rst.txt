Easy to use
   Based on a decorator, to add on any annotated function or class

Support for various annotation styles
   Usable with Annotated object or string annotations

Integration with popular Python type checkers.
   Can be used along mypy for powerful typing systems

No additional runtime overhead
   Impunity works directly on the AST for a static analysis of your code
